# Basic Hospital Data Management System
#### Simple C++ Program to learn to work with records and their manipulations

This project aims at creating a very useful and efficient program which any of the staff in the hospital can access. This database is for the use of the hospital staff only. It is used to store all the information regarding any person working for the hospital, ranging from the patients to the doctors to even the other employees associated with the organisation. The user can access the data and perform various functions such as searching for the records, modifying the records, viewing all or a specific record as well as deleting the record. Attention has been given to the detail of information stored, especially for the patients where an additional feature of calculating their bill has been provided. The Program has been divided into three major parts:
